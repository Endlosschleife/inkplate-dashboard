# Inkplate Dashboard

This project uses the [Home Assistant Facade API](https://github.com/Endlosschleife/home-assistant-facade) to collect calendar and weather information and show them on an [Inkplate 6](https://inkplate.io/) e-Ink display.

Please note that this project uses [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).

Thanks to e-radionica for the great examples on https://github.com/e-radionicacom/Inkplate-6-Arduino-library.
